## DemolitionDerbyGamemode, a little Project [Scotty](https://github.com/ScottUK) aka [Scott_UK](https://forum.fivem.net/u/Scott_uk) and [myself](https://github.com/Flatracer) ([Flatracer](https://forum.fivem.net/u/Flatracer)) created and still work on.

This is a Gamemode for [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) which is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V.

It is still at the very beginning and a work in progess.

The goal of this project is to create a Demolition Derby experience in FiveM. Most of basic stuff needed is already done.
It may not always be the best way to do things, but that is alright for now.

## How to play it?

You can host it yourself or you play on the official testing Server: FiveM | Demolition Derby (45.58.61.117:30122)
